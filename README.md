# BlueFlag

This is a project to recreate DPRK's Red Flag application that's used in all civillian devices in North Kores. You'll know if Red Flag is being used if you the flag icon on your apps or on your taskbar icons. An example of Red Flag being used is in distrubuting client-side copies inside of the desktop version of Red Star OS.
